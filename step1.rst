SciApps Basics and Logging In
------------------------------

SciApps leverages CyVerse Agave API and Data Store for efficient data transfer,
analysis, and management across heterogeneous systems. A CyVerse account is
required to access these systems.

**Some things to remember about the platform**

*Sample datasets*

- Sample datasets are available under the ‘example’ tab. These datasets are
  prepared for the public workflows (CyVerse credentials required for browsing)
- More sample datasets are available under the ‘shared’ tab (CyVerse
  credentials required). From there, sample datasets for most apps are available
  in the Data Store  ‘/iplant/home/shared/iplantcollaborative/example_data/’

*Logging into SciApps*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Access the SciApps website at https://www.SciApps.org/

  2. Click on ‘Login’ (from the top navigation bar), you will be directed to the
     CyVerse Authentication Service page

  3. Enter your CyVerse username and CyVerse password, you will be redirected
     back to SciApps if successfully authenticated

     .. Tip::
        To log out of SciApps and CyVerse, you need to click on 'Logout' from
        the top navigation bar. Additionally, job histories in the right panel
        will be discarded after closing or refreshing the browser tab. To load

*Access SciApps Without Logging In*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without logging in, you cannot view data in CyVerse Data Store, submit analysis
jobs, or save workflows. You can however preview applications and public workflows.

   1. Access the SciApps website at https://www.SciApps.org/

   2. To preview the SciApps and their parameters, load any App by clicking on
      the App name in Apps panel (left panel)

   3. To preview public workflows, click "Workflow" on the menu at the top of
      the page. Select 'Public workflows' (workflow templates) to preview.
